## Data lineage analysis command line tool
### Parameters
#### /showResultSetTypes
There are many types of [the intermediate result sets](./basic-concepts/7-intermediate-resultset.md#intermediate-result-sets) will be generated during the analysis of the data lineage in SQL query.
When we ignore all the intermediate result sets (using `/s` option), the data lineage generated only includes the base tables and views.

However, sometimes, we may want to see the data lineage of the intermediate result sets, for example, we want to see the data lineage of the result set generated by the aggregate function, or the result set generated by the insert/update clause in merge statement.

In this case, we can use `/showResultSetTypes` option to specify the types of the result sets to be output.

The result set types can be specified in the following format:

```
/showResultSetTypes array, struct, result_of, cte, insert_select, update_select, merge_update, merge_insert, output, update_set, pivot_table, unpivot_table, alias, rs, function, case_when
```

This option is valid only when `/s` option is used.

#### /withTemporaryTable
Temporary table such as `#temp_table` in SQL Server will not be output in simple output by default.
If you want to output the temporary table, you can use `/withTemporaryTable` option.

```
/withTemporaryTable true
```
