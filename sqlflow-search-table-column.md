## Data lineage in 3 steps: Search, Select and Visualize

Sometimes, it's not easy to find the data flow of a specific table or column
in a giant map of the enterprise's data lineage.

Since [the SQLFlow frontend version 2.1.9](https://sqlflow.gudusoft.com), it is never so easy to find 
the table and column in the schema explorer.

Just enter the name of a table or column. [The SQLFlow](https://sqlflow.gudusoft.com) will highlight the founded 
table or column automatically in the schema explorer, then select and visualize 
the table or column with a right mouse click.
SQLFlow will display the data lineage of the selected table or column instantly.
